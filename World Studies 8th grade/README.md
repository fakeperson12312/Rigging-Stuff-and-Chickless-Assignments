This contains chickless edpuzzle answers for the wy 2024-2025 school year, all that I could get.  
The first month and later months aren't there because I don't feel like adding that stuff do it urself,  
Yes I do know that i could use quizlet  
also if ur a cheater make a bookmark and copy and paste this into it: 'javascript: fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ading2210/edpuzzle-answers@latest/script.js").then(r => r.text()).then(r => eval(r))'  
Simple code from another source. Credits to https://edpuzzle.hs.vc/ for that Note: It won't work on ur chromebook and ur school google acc because bookmark js is disabled,  
use another google acc and login with that google acc. The other tech stuff is in another folder
Another way is using ur chromebook's media player to skip vids.
