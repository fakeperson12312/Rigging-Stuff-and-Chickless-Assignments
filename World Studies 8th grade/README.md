# Info from first readme
This contains chickless edpuzzle answers for the wy 2024-2025 school year, all that I could get.  
The first month and later months aren't there because I don't feel like adding that stuff do it urself,  
Yes I do know that i could use quizlet  
also if ur a cheater make a bookmark and copy and paste this into it: 'javascript: fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ading2210/edpuzzle-answers@latest/script.js").then(r => r.text()).then(r => eval(r))'  
Simple code from another source. Credits to https://edpuzzle.hs.vc/ for that Note: It won't work on ur chromebook and ur school google acc because bookmark js is disabled,  
use another google acc and login with that google acc. The other tech stuff is in another folder

# simple heck
a chromebook media player thingy will popup on ur taskbar with a music and 3 lines symbol (last i checked), drag that to the end then answer all the questions. ull still have to watch the video again though

# additional info
If you actually want to learn content ahead of time, i have the chapters here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aeqMdSg8_u7sH-VaMk8WHxfnzFjIJFv8  
And to get the edpuzzles before he posts them, create an edpuzzle account as a teacher and search the titles that I have included in the folders (some had a / in them beforehand, which i changed to other words though)
