# This is October's answers to each assignment. 
Note: These are my answers, so they might not be correct, and idc about recording stuff in detail just dont copy it. Also, for the edpuzzle, those are multiple choice (mainly), so those are correct (as long as i can type)
btw, for the ones before october (or before after 1 month of whenever school starts at the time of u reading this (terrible grammar u can interpret it however u want)), there's going to be a park avenue documetary with questions, athenians and visigothsm (ill include the ones from 2023-2024 not 2024-2025 bc im to lazy to switch the google acc again)

(I'm not including the ones about rome for now, because of time.)
