# ICS assignments' answers
This will not include personal projects, some answers may not be the best, and I may be too lazy to think of the best solutions
Some are some gifts from other people with their projects
Some files might not be readable, so maybe just directly download it? 
Here's the google drive for it anyway:

bc ICS is kinda free and like 1 point doesn't matter.
