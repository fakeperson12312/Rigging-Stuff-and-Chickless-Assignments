# ICS assignments' answers
This will not include personal projects, some answers may not be the best, and I may be too lazy to think of the best solutions - aka i was too lazy and i can take a few points off (btw only the first few are here, some will be in the google drive)
Some are some gifts from other people with their projects
Some files might not be readable, so maybe just directly download it? 
Here's the google drive for it anyway:
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AWojN39c36-nIECr5hfGOwHACU-31OXI
(It'll be updated when it's updated, soo that may be at the very end of the year ill get around to it)
bc ICS is kinda free and like 1 point doesn't matter. 
And i've tried redacting all the names, if u find one just ignore it
