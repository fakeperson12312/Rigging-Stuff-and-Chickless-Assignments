# This is a small guide on how to get websites for free, to access from anywhere.
So, you have a "few" free options. I'll just list them out, you can do what you want with them.  
Cloudflare pages  
Vercel  - blocked
Render  
Google sites  - terrible for coding
Stackblitz  - idek
Glitch  - pretty good 
Github Pages  - static
Railway (limited) - yeah.. idek

My favorites are **Render, Github pages (mine got blocked), Glitch, and Cloudflare Pages**  
Vercel isn't on there because it's blocked, and some other ones that i didn't list are also blocked like surge
