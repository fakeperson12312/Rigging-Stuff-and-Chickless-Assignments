# IDK what's gonna be in here, just gonna list like one or two things for now
There's a few good websites for coding that I like that i can actually access at school, like github itself, with github codespaces, replit (kind of needs money now, only 3 free repos), glitch (for web), and stackblitz. Some can't be accessed at home, and each has its own restrictions, I like glitch but no sudo(admin) access in the terminal, and it has good enough usage, 1000 hours per month, just use it wisely, don't open like 20 different services and give it out to a public discord server with 2 million people. Only 200 mb storage though. Stackblitz is okay ig, also web development.
