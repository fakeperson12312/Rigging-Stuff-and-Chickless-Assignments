# IDK what's gonna be in here, just gonna list like one or two things for now
There's a few good websites for coding that I like that i can actually access at school, like github itself, with github codespaces, replit (kind of needs money now, only 3 free repos), glitch (for web), and stackblitz. Some can't be accessed at home, and each has its own restrictions, I like glitch but no sudo(admin) access in the terminal, and it has good enough usage, 1000 hours per month, just use it wisely, don't open like 20 different services and give it out to a public discord server with 2 million people. Only 200 mb storage though. Stackblitz is okay ig, also web development. 


# This part is a guilde to get a website for free on linux
The domains won't be pretty, but they'll work. '''bash sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y sudo apt-get install apache2 nginx -y ''' Now, install ngrok. This is the simple way (simplest for me) '''bash sudo apt-get install snapd -y sudo snap install ngrok ''' Now, to start ngrok you have to create an account and go to the tab called authtoken and copy and paste the line of code into the bash terminal Next, start apache2 '''bash sudo systemctl start apache2 ''' Then, start ngrok '''bash ngrok http 80 ''' Then, given the link provided, paste that into the search bar and click visit site to see the apache2 index.html file. It's stored in /var/www/html/index.html, so if you want to edit it: '''bash sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html ''' or '''bash sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html '''
