# Intro
So, if u guys know what kasm is, good. Skip the next part. If you don't, just read the next part.

Kasm is a place where you can get different desktops and other things, completely bypassing cps defenses. 
The best part is that with my method, pretty simple, it can't be blocked at all. 
There's some issue with the fps, but there are some adjustable settings for that. This is kind of unnecesary though, 
becuase of croxy proxy. You can access it through the ipv4 https://157.245.18.208/ And, here's another proxy,   
though the loading speed is a bit low. http://rh.teamclbesh.net/ - ignore http not https

# Yap about stuff, you might want to read this
There are two ways, your own server at home, or one on the cloud. For the one on the cloud, it's a bit simpler
but It will cost money, like $5 a month. BUT, kasmweb.com is blocked as a security.proxy from goofy aws blocking. For the server at home, there's a good guide by network chuck that i'm too lazy to find again. Go search on youtube: network chuck kasm install
or maybe something like that, idrk. It was called getting a secure browser though. There's also a great official guide on how to install it, so that's the best way to install it. I'm just gonna list some commands fro you to use. 

But, you need to be able to get a linux computer, with a terminal. There has to be enough storage and enough computer requirements, like the official is 50gb, 2cpu cores, and 4gb of ram. In reality, 50gb is over the limit, but the other ones you might actually want, but lowering the limit is fine. If you don't have a computer at home, here's where a lot of stuff online
comes in. Linode is actually really good, and I won't go over it, but that's just network chuck's video again. My way is completely free though, no account sign in or anything. As long as you have the requirements, you'll be fine. Side note: for some reason some old computers might not work, still haven't figured it out. If you're on mac, I guess go to the terminal and install
brew, and with brew install multipass, literally just those three words to install it. Now you can create a new VM, but u can 
guide yourself through it. Virtualbox also works, but only a command line is needed. IF you're on windows, use wsl. That's a pretty
simple install. I'm also assuming you aren't trying to get people to use your kasm server for profit, so I won't go over creating
multiple accounts like i did. 

# Actual Installing
Hopefully you have a debian based or ubuntu based system.
