# This is a short list of all the interesting things I've configured
Starting from 10-7-24, this has some stuff after that and some stuff that I can remeber from before that. 
(The ones that are possibly useful to msot people because I've done a lot of goofy ah projects)
Anyway, there's also a couple of extensions that are games that are really nice, you just have to install it from another computer to access it on your computer.
Just go to the chrome web store, games, and then there will be a bunch of boxel things, those are nice. I also like the arcade extension, but some are viruses btw, so be careful.
