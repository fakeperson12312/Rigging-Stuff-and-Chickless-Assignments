This is the way of creating a server on github. 
Follow the instructions from: https://github.com/fakeperson12312/server-test (lol totally not just stolen from somewhere else)
So click the green code button to see two options: local and codespaces. Go to codespaces, add a new one, then control-shift-p and search terminal, choose write data to terminal or smth, open it up
Copy and paste the instructions, or if ur like me and actually know how to do this cs stuff, u can modify anything u want. The first time you run it, it needs to you edit the eula.txt
What you can do is go to the "server" directory, nano eula.txt (these files won't be here before you run it), and change the eula=false to eula=TRUE Then follow the instructions again.
