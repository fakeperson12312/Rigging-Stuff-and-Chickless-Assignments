https://github.com/BarneyCompiler/AstraClientEagler - Download then open it in web browser, it gives u a smoother and less laggy eaglercraft thing, only 1.8.8
https://1l56df6.github.io/eagler-all-versions/v0.6.1/index.html - This may or may not be a hack client, pretty laggy though
https://github.com/IsmaelTechDEV/EaglerXVelocity - This one doesn't allow multiple ips on it, but you can config it if you want. This one allows voice chat but just use discord dont ever use this goofy ah thing
https://github.com/IsmaelTechProxy/server-test - Main thing that I use. It's stable and stuff. 
I created a few clones of all of this github stuff, except the 2nd one which may be a hack client, who knows? There's plenty out there, go find some yourself, it's not that hard.

That's a link for my eaglercraft codes and stuff
Pretty sure there's some other links for getting higher versions of eaglercraft working, not sure what the links are though.
But here's some of my own websites for eaglercraft (not self-hosted but on vercel) (cloudflare pages works, along with render) 
If u want self-hosted, go do some nginx work or apache.

https://testing-sable-sigma.vercel.app/ - Sigma original version
