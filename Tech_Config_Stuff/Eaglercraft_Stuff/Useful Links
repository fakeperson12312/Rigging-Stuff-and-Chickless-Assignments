https://github.com/BarneyCompiler/AstraClientEagler - Download then open it in web browser, it gives u a smoother and less laggy eaglercraft thing, only 1.8.8
https://1l56df6.github.io/eagler-all-versions/v0.6.1/index.html - This may or may not be a hack client, pretty laggy though
https://github.com/IsmaelTechDEV/EaglerXVelocity - This one doesn't allow multiple ips on it, but you can config it if you want. This one allows voice chat but just use discord dont ever use this goofy ah thing
https://github.com/IsmaelTechProxy/server-test - Main thing that I use. It's stable and stuff. 
I created a few clones of all of this github stuff, except the 2nd one which may be a hack client, who knows? There's plenty out there, go find some yourself, it's not that hard.
