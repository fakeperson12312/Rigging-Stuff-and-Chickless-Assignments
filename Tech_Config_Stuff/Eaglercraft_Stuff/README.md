# Clients
The newest clients are wasm (at the time of writing), and they have pretty good fps. The official eaglercraft website hasn't been blocked by lightspeed filter agent yet, and that has wasm.   
For the regular clients without wasm, the best is resent client (anime mode ðŸ”¥!!! /j)  
For the wasm client, the best currently has to be astraclient.

# Benefits of clients
Most of the better clients provide mods, like noswingdelay, fps boosting settings, togglesprint, etc, and shadow client (search it up) lets u get custom mods. 
This can result in better fps, quality of gaming stuff, and a bunch of other benefits. Also if u know js then u can actually code ur own mod, it's pretty easy to code a hack client for some reason. 

# Some of my simple Ealgercraft rigged things, the longer process ones take too much time to do a writeup on
Firstly, if you have a spare computer at home where you can keep it on, not sleeping, taking in electricity, perfect, use the creating_server_home file.
Otherwise, the creating server github version is good enough. You can also create your own eaglercraft website, it might run faster, idk and idc i just use the actual one with the extra skins that are so w. 
I might add my docs with links to them, but by the time anybody sees this, all the links and websites and servers probably won't be open
